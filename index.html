        <p>
        I am a Master's student at the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/">University of Calgary</a>. My research focuses on the predictors of developing serious mental illness in youth. I anticipate to graduate in June 2023, and plan to pursue a career change into Web Development. I am currently completing an online Web Development bootcamp by Udemy and plan to pursue a more rigorous bootcamp with Lighthouse Labs in the fall of 2023. In my spare time, I like to go to the gym, play video games with friends, as well as try out new restaurants in Calgary.
